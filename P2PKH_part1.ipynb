    "This is one more attemp to explain how to create a bitcoin P2PKH (Pay to Public Key Hash) transaction from scratch in Python. What i have not found in other tutorials (Karpathy, Shirriff,...) is how to create a transaction with multiple inputs and outputs as also the verification of the generated signatures with the signatures from Bitcoin Core. I will use the same deterministic ECDSA signature process as bitcoin core. I find it more helpful because it is clear if the raw transaction that we are signing is not build correctly. We will also explore the functionality of Bitcoin Core Console commands, and use it to validate our results.\n",

    "As the name suggests P2PKH stands for Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash. This means that we are sending the coins to key hash of a public key. How do we get a public key? Bitcoin uses the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) to create a public key from a random 256 bits number which is called the private key. The main property of the ECDSA is that it is very easy to create a public key from a private key but it is impossible (computanilly very very expensive) to create a private key from a public key. One good introduction to ECDSA is this one\n",

    "1. Generate a random 256 bits number (private key)\n",

    "3. Hash the public key with SHA256 and RIPEMD160 to get the key hash, add bytes to indicate the network (mainnet or testnet) and the checksum. Encode the result with base58 encoding to get the address\n",
